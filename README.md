# Secure Motorcycle Companion (SMC)

## Overview

The Secure Motorcycle Companion (SMC) is a safety system designed to enhance motorcycle rider safety by enforcing helmet compliance, detecting crashes, and facilitating rapid emergency responses. Developed by the BSSE-25-29 group at Makerere University’s School of Computing and Informatics Technology, this project addresses Uganda’s high motorcycle accident rates, where riders contribute to 0.03% of annual fatalities (Uganda Police Force, 2023). The SMC integrates hardware and software to ensure rider protection through real-time monitoring and automated alerts.
